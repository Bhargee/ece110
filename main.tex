\section*{Introduction}
The goal of the ECE 110 final lab project is to design, implement, test, and
debug an autonomous vehicle that, using infrared sensors, can acurately follow
a track. Students had the option of designing and implementing a car that
utilized TTL circuit logic or one that used an Arduino micrcontroller. We decided to use an Arduino microcontroller (specifically the Arduino Micro board) for
the sake of simplicity and ease. We were more familiar with the programming
concepts that an Arduino based design required. Using an Arduino and two H-bridges, we have succesfully implemented an autonomous vehicle that follows a grid,
only turning when the car's sensors detect grey tape. The design also incorporates an element of state remembrance, as it correctly implements turns on T and cross intersections by ``remembering'' turn indicators placed several inches away
from such intersections.
